# Project Name

FirstResponder-AI - Real-time Voice Agent for Customer Support

# Description

FirstResponder-AI is an innovative real-time voice agent that revolutionizes customer support by leveraging OpenAI's Realtime APIs and Azure Communication Services. It provides instant, natural, and human-like conversations with minimal latency.

# Problem Definition:

![banner](/documents/assets/banner-image.png)

1. **Traditional Customer Support Limitations:** Current IVR and human agent systems suffer from long wait times, limited availability, and high operational costs.
2. **Need for Scalable Solutions:** Organizations need a solution that can handle fluctuating call volumes while maintaining consistent service quality.
3. **Language and Accessibility Barriers:** Traditional support systems often struggle with multilingual support and 24/7 availability.
4. **Cost Efficiency Challenges:** Companies face significant expenses in maintaining traditional customer support infrastructure.

## Implementation Overview:

FirstResponder-AI implements a sophisticated architecture that combines multiple Azure services to deliver a seamless voice agent experience:

1. **Frontend Layer:**
   - Next.js 15 and React 19 for a modern, responsive dashboard
   - Real-time communication interface using Azure Communication Services
   - Tailwind CSS for beautiful UI components

2. **Backend Services:**
   - Python-based Quart async web framework for handling real-time communications
   - Azure OpenAI Service for natural language processing and response generation
   - Azure Communication Services for voice handling and call management
   - Azure Event Grid for event processing and system coordination

3. **Storage and Analytics:**
   - Azure Blob Storage for call recordings and data persistence
   - Azure Queue Storage for managing transcription tasks
   - Azure Table Storage for call information and metadata

## Azure Services Integration:

The system leverages several key Azure services:

1. **Azure Communication Services:**
   - Handles voice calls and real-time communication
   - Manages call recording and streaming
   - Enables multi-channel support

2. **Azure OpenAI Service:**
   - Powers real-time voice conversations
   - Enables natural language understanding and generation
   - Provides multilingual support

3. **Azure AI Speech:**
   - Handles transcription and speaker diarization
   - Enables sentiment analysis
   - Generates call summaries and insights

## Application Flow:

1. **Call Initiation:**
   - Customer initiates call through Azure Communication Services
   - System establishes real-time connection with OpenAI

2. **Real-time Processing:**
   - Voice input is processed through Azure AI Speech
   - OpenAI generates contextual responses
   - Azure Communication Services delivers voice response

3. **Post-call Processing:**
   - Call recording is stored in Azure Blob Storage
   - Transcription and analysis performed by recorder-fn
   - Results available in dashboard for review
